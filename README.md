This code produces Bayesian decisions using normative (pracitcal reasoning) and directional priors (motivated reasoning). See section II of paper. 
Directional priors are Bayesian priors conditioned on a utility-calculus. Simultations from normative and directed Bayesian posetiors can be
compared to behavioral data to disnguish between cases of practical and motivated reasoning. Knowing the difference can motivate how a research 
choses to revise a related belief. We discuss how in the paper.
